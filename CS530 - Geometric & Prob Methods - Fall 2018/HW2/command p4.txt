% Problem 4

clear
X = readpgm("lena.pgm");
Px = grey_histogram(X);
Y = readpgm("lena-jpeg.pgm");
Py = grey_histogram(Y);
[Px_y, Pxy] = image_conditional_joint(X,Y);
[Py_x, temp] = image_conditional_joint(Y,X);

% (1) The entropy of the lena image
Hx = entropy_Hx(Px)

% (2) The entropy of the lena-jpeg image
Hy = entropy_Hx(Py)

% (3) The channel noise
Hy_x = entropy_Hy_x(Pxy, Py_x)

% (4) The channel loss
Hx_y = entropy_Hx_y(Pxy,Px_y)

% (5) Mutual Information
Ixy_fromY = Hy-Hy_x

Ixy_fromX = Hx-Hx_y

% Since the Ixy calculated from Hy-Hy_x is the same as the Ixy calculated from Hx-Hx_y, the calculations are likely to be correct.
